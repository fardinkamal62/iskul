A replica of my college's class room portal with added features and far better than the them.

I just did the back-end part. I don't know much HTML, CSS as you can see.
I cordially welcome someone to do the front-end part


## Features
+ ##### Principal: Principal can see attendance of all teacher and student and also participate in class
+ ##### Teachers: Teachers can participate in class and can only see their students attendance
+ ##### Students: Students can participate in class and exam



## Live Demo
You can log into the portal as Student/Principal/Teacher using these credentials:


Designation   | Roll  | Password

Student       | 2     | fardin
